## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea

A web-based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software could be a fantastic idea for a hackathon! Here's a concept to consider:

This software could simulate real-world selection processes, such as job recruitment, college admissions, or grant applications. It could include features like:

Role-based Simulations: Allow users to act as selectors or applicants, providing insights into both perspectives.

AI-Powered Feedback: Use AI to evaluate applications and provide constructive feedback to applicants.

Customizable Scenarios: Enable organizations to create tailored simulations for their specific needs.

Data Analytics: Offer insights into selection trends, biases, and areas for improvement.
